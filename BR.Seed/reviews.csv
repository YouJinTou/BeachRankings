It is highly dependent on tides. Access to the coral reef is easy on the pontoons. Coral reef is nice, but relatively uniform. It is an almost vertical wall with beautiful coral. The wall ranges from 7 to 15 meters. Then the bottom is relatively rocky and the depth increases sharply. The slope of the coral wall is at an angle of 80-90 degrees. Snorkeling is like swimming parallel to the wall. Despite the beautiful coral wall, snorkeling itself is very monotonous. Just a wall overgrown with nice coral, after which the depth becomes significant. Snorkeling here is not suitable for weak swimmers or people who are afraid of the deep. Expect a gentle sea current, parallel to the shore, with a frequently changing direction. Better swimmers can extend their snorkeling area to the north as well as to the south. There are a lot of pontoons in both directions, where they can relax if needed. The beach is not protected by the north and east winds prevailing in the winter.

Banana Beach,2018-03-17 22:32:35.837,"Very nice, wide and clean beach. Good with kids as it's quite shallow water for quite a bit of distance. The beach is about 1500m long and slopes gently into the sea. The water sports centre is off to the side - paragliding, jet skis, canoes and more, and do not interfere with the beach, so it is safe for children.",5,8.2,8,4.5,2.7,8,5,8.6,9,2,0,1,2,8,0,8
Navagio Beach,2018-03-17 22:47:52.523,Best place to go if you're a beach lover; the color of water is unreal of blue and the abandoned wreck on the beach creates a very beautiful picture. The beach can only be seen from the top of the cliff and and if you want to reach it go to an 1 day cruise because you'll see navagio and another amazing virgin beaches from the island.  The image of blue water and golden sand blends perfectly so do not miss the opportunity to take some beautiful pictures.,4.2,8,8.8,9.5,5,0,7,9.5,9.5,2,0,1,1,1,0,0

Koroni Beach,2018-03-18 16:22:12.430,Koroni Beach Type-sand and pebbles Size-medium long but large Facilities - is not equipped for tourists Food-There is a small bar on the beach for drinks and snacks  Description the road to get to Koroni beach is unpaved and not suitable for all cars. The beach is very nice and the sea is really stunning here. The shades of colors that you see coming from above the beach are breathtaking. The stretch of coast on the left is all made of clay and then you can also put the mud all over your face or all over the body. We must get the mud on the body and wait for it to dry and then have a swim in the sea to clean up. The result is an extremely smooth skin.,3.9,5,7.5,6,5,1,5,9.5,4,3,0,1,4,6,1,1
Kaminia Beach,2018-03-18 16:43:57.887,"Kaminia Beach Type-sand Size-together are up to 2 km long. While Kaminia is approximately 25 meters large, Potamakia is almost 80 meters. Facilities-Kaminia has several points with loungers and umbrellas for rent and Potamakia only one, upon the arrival of the road Food-along the beach of Kaminia there are a few bars while there are none in Potamakia Description Kaminia Potamakia together are the southern beaches of the island of Kefalonia.

Kaminia also called Mounda is perhaps the only remaining beach in Kefalonia nesting turtles Caretta-Caretta.

Mytros Beach,2018-03-18 21:04:53.247,"Mytros beach is stunning with tirquase crystal clear waters! Consists of pure white pebbles which is hard to walk.  Beach shoes help walk on the pebbles!.  Facilities-there are sun beds and umbrellas for rent and showers right in the middle of the beach Food-there is a bar on the beach and in the high season some trailer that serves as bar It’s surrounded by high cliffs and there is only one road that from the village of Divarata will lead you down to Myrtos bay. The beach is huge and therefore the areas free of deck chairs are many, even if it is crowded in August. The sea has a depth that degrades very quickly and at the left end of the beach there are also a cave where you can pass through. There are also panoramic spots, going on the coastal road to Assos, where you can admire the beach as a whole. Myrtos has the sunset right in front and then if you stay late at the beach you can also enjoy the calm sea and the shades of pink in the sky. Another peculiarity is that the sea a bit 'rough water becomes an almost electric fluorescent blue.",5.2,7,7.7,9,3.3,6,6,9.5,7,3,0,1.5,7,6,0,5
Petani Beach,2018-03-18 22:54:55.393,"Petani beach is one of the best beaches in Kefalonia. Light Blue water seems like swimming pool.  Wide beach in two parts. Main part sandy/pebbly with beds and parasols available. Plenty of other space to choose though. Right side of the beach is divided by a rocky outcrop but did provide some lovely little coves with some shaded areas. Sea access is tricky but shoes did help. Water clear and warm. Beach shelved steeply but provided a lovely swimming area. ",4.8,5,8.4,7.8,4,5,7,9.7,4,3,0,2,8,5,0,3

Playa de illetas,2018-09-24 20:35:42.877,"This is really a must see location! The area is part of the national park with an organised car park due to its popularity which has charges for motorized transport so my advice is use the local bus service which takes you right into the area. The beaches are white sand, turquoise coloured seas with shallow waters, some beach areas are organised with sun beds & shades as well as a selection of places to eat and drink (but can be very expensive!) The area can get very busy as expected with day visitors from Ibiza but continue walking and the crowds thin out and the views get better!",5.4,8.2,7.8,7,5,5,7.7,9,9,3.5,0,1.5,1.5,9.5,1,5
